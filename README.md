# Porfolio
Coding tasks that I have done in a public portfolio

## Challenges File Description
These are coding challenges that I have done. Typically these are efficiency tasks however, some have not had the efficiency of the code analysed for them.
So far all are in python and the files are in .ipynb file format with a description of the task completed, analysis and notes. As well as the actual python code itself
