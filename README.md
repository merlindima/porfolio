# Porfolio
Coding tasks that I have done in a public portfolio

## Challenges File Description
These are coding challenges that I have done. Some these are efficiency tasks however, some have not had the efficiency of the code analysed for them. Others are simply coding challenges from websites that I have done.

So far all are in python and the files are in .ipynb file format with a description of the task completed, analysis and notes. As well as the actual python code itself
